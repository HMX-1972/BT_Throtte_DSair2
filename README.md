The standard firmware is a Bluetooth keyboard specification for the DCC model railroad controller DSAir2 (manufactured by Desktop Station), but it can be used with various devices by reorganizing the firmware.

It can also be connected to other devices via Bluetooth and WiFi. Please note that serial communication cannot be used (this is for exclusive use with the keyboard. Firmware can be rewritten via USB).
